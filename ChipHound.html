        <span> The ChipHound app is a complimentary mobile platform that comes with the ChipHound sticker,
             a tracking adhesive that allows people to find any lost belongings. Simply attach the sticker 
             to any personal belongings, and then track it through the ChipHound app.

        <span> Millennials, parents and travellers- our market research found that these 3 segments were 
            the most likely to lose belongings everyday from things like their phones to their underwear!
             ChipHound wanted to be the product that would solve the simple problems in everyday life, 
             starting with saving people from losing their valuable belongings.

                3. Create an application that would be easy to navigate so that our targeted audience would not 
                feel demotivated and stressed as they search for their belongings

        <span> Together with my team, we developed the main functionality of the mobile application on Balsamiq, 
            which were to:
            <p></p>
            -   Add personal belongings
            <p></p>
            -   Track an item
            <p></p>
            -   Trigger an alarm when the user starts tracking the item.

        <span> Inspired by the invention of the name ChipHound itself and coloured gradients, I designed a

        <span> I compiled some feedback from my team and a few users about the visual identity and then 
            created high fidelity wireframes on Adobe XD.

        <div class="description" id="reflectionDescription" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> The project was really fun because I was the only designer in the team and it gave me a lot of 
            freedom on developing the design of the app. However, because of the short time frame I could not 
            fully develop the application. In the future, I would like to take the time to conduct user testing 
            and collect feedback for the prototype to create more design iterations.
