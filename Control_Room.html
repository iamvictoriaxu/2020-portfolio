    <div id="pageTitle"> Control Room</div>
        <div class="description" id="CRdescription" data-aos="fade-up">
        <span> Control Room is a desktop application that enables businesses to measure their 
            performance metrics and monitor the statuses of their systems through dashboards. 
        </span>
        </div>

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up">01. the goal</div>
        <div class="description" id="goalCR" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> My mission for Control Room was to use my creativity to simplify the UI flow so that 
            clients could understand the performance of their business on comprehensive dashboards. 
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up" id="step2">02. who was it for?</div>
        <div class="description" id="client" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> Large banks such as ANZ and NAB using Accenture’s Automatic Ticket Resolver (ATR). 
            ATR is a machine learning platform which automatically solves issues that are often given
             to customer service desks. Control room was used to maintain the automation process and 
             monitor ATR.  
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up" id="step3">03. the problem</div>
        <div class="description" id="problem" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> 1. The original platform was hard to navigate because it reflected the complexity of ATR’s system
                <p></p>
                2. There was little design elements, as it was implemented without a designer
                <p></p>
                3. Dashboard pages had repetitive data and were overloaded with information
                <p></p>
                4. Users had difficulty understanding their business performance 
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up" id="step4">04. the solution<p>Creating the navigation</p></div>
        <div class="description" id="solution1" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> I created a sitemap that categorised the pages by system so that pages were digestible and users could 
            effortlessly find the information they were looking for. 
        </span>
    </div>
    <img src="Controlroom/sitemap@4x.png" class="solutionImage" id="CRS1">

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up" id="subheading">Redesigning the interface </div>
        <div class="description" id="solution2" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> I opted for a colour blocking theme with the blue to remain consistent with Accenture’s 
            pre-existing colours as Control Room was to be deployed as part of a suite. 
            <p></p>
            I used white as a neutral background to offset the block colours used throughout the pages 
            and minimise the look of the comprehensive dashboards. Green and red block colours were used 
            as status buttons to indicate whether the system has failed or is currently active.     
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up">Organising contents to improve discoverability</div>
        <div class="description" id="goalCR" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> I reorganised repetitive data into containers to represent each system so that information 
            could be easily analysed by the user. Corners of containers were rounded to give a modern look 
            and to indicate the start and end of the page as users scroll.    
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up">Guiding users on technical information</div>
        <div class="description" id="goalCR" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> During usability testing, I discovered a pain point that users found was that they could 
            not understand the platform as it required a level of technical knowledge. Therefore, I built 
            on-hover tool-tips to help provide additional information.     
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="stepTitle" data-aos="fade-up">05. Reflections and takeaways</div>
        <div class="description" id="goalCR" data-aos="fade-up" >
        <span> I had a lot of fun with this project because I was given the opportunity to learn new 
            skills like coding the front end of the application. However because the timeline was short, 
            I skipped parts of the design process such as low fidelity designs and market research. In 
            the future, I would like to conduct more usability testing, gain more feedback and personalise 
            the experience more businesses.
