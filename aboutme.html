        <span> Hi there! My name is Victoria Xu. I am a UI/UX designer based in Sydney, currently building 
            a mobile and web application for Woolworths. I have been creating and designing experiences for 
            2 years now. I love bringing detail into everything I design and am a strong believer that life 
            is all about colour!
            <p></p>
            When I am not designing, I am studying a Commerce and Economics degree at the University of New South 
            Wales or travelling the world. It was through studying abroad and my design experience that I 
            discovered a passion for helping improve customer experiences through emerging technologies and 
            human centred design. Now I am fueled by anything that allows me to learn new skill sets in 
            these areas and jampack them into my brain. 
            <p></p>
            I also enjoy watching a good movie and am an old soul when it comes to my love for jazz and picnics!
